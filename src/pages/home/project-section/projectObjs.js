Main functions currently include, searching the shelf by title or author, sorting shelf by author, title or rating, and filtering shelf based on read status, and or rating. Application is built with the base ReactJS, with Axios library for API interactions. All menus, dropdowns and functions are custom built for application. CSS was used for project styling.",
				commentsTakeaways:

				overview:
					"I replaced the todo list concept with a project manager application. I made the project list  sortable by task numbers, project priority urgency, and by completion date.  Users can edit the project details, and delete each project (currently, there is no pop-up confirmation to delete a project, which could lead to a stored project being easily deleted on accident by the user). By clicking on a project that project is then displayed, showing a description of the project, and a list of the project's tasks. Users are able to add tasks to the project from this page, and once added, tasks can be marked as completed, or deleted (tasks are not editable at this time, also no deletion confirmation is asked before a task is deleted). Display of tasks can be filtered by all, open, and completed.",
				commentsTakeaways:
					"If application was going to be fully deployed, I would redesign the layout of the sorting options.  Both new project and new task pop-up window do not have a button to close them, the only way to close them is with the escape key. Projects and tasks do not have a confirmation for the user when they are being deleted, leaving a higher chance for a project or task to be accidentally deleted. Tasks do not have an option to be updated. ",

				overview:

At this time I used the HTML files from the mockups and made each file a template and stored them in a JavaScript module. Once the corresponding page is clicked from the main navigation, the template is inserted after the body element instead of generating each HTML element individually in JavaScript. CSS makes heavy use of individual element class names for styling and for a larger project that would not be scalable.",
