				commentsTakeaways:
					"This website did not need to be built with React, but I chose to do so to reinforce my knowledge of React. This allowed me to make a React contact form, and gave me exposure to React Router.",

Project is a single-page application using React to generate, and update the content of the application.",
				overview:
					"Project concept was to incorporate data pulled from an API into an application that lets users add, update and change the data once it has been added and saved by the user. Main functions currently include, searching the shelf for a book by title or author, sorting the books on the shelf by author, title or rating, and filtering the shelf based on read status, and or rating. Application is built with the base React JavaScript, with Axios library for API interactions. All menus, dropdowns and functions are custom built for application, with CSS being used for project styling.",
				mainChallenges: [
					"This project is the first application that I utilized React, using State and Effect to make the application responsive. All menus and drop-down components have been made custom, in place of using a library, to better reinforce my knowledge of React. I used Google books API to pull the data for each book displayed.",

				commentsTakeaways:
					"I did not pre-plan the full functionality of this project, or outline a design before starting work on the project. This leads to each update in features causing a layout and style update. Without a base plan of the project, it has made the scaling of the project more difficult and time consuming, with a lot of time still needed to refactor the applications CSS file.",

Once added to the dashboard, users can click on the project to open a full view of that project. From the full view users can add tasks for the project, mark tasks completed, and delete tasks. The project list is sortable by tasks on each project, project urgency, and by completion date. Users can edit the project details, and delete each project. When viewing the tasks, tasks can be filtered by all, open, and completed.",

				commentsTakeaways:
					"Currently is not fully responsive, and will not display properly on small mobile screens. The layout for sorting the projects is a bit confusing and could use a redesign if the application was fully deployed. Currently, the add project and add task pop up windows do not have a close button, and can only be closed with the esc key. When deleting a project or task there is not a confirmation for the user, leaving a higher chance for an accidental deletion. Tasks do not have an option to be updated.",

				"This was an assignment from The Odin Project used to reinforce knowledge of JS modules and DOM manipulation.",

At this time I used the HTML files from the mockups, and made each file a template and stored them in a JavaScript module. Once the corresponding page is clicked from the main navigation, the template is inserted after the body element instead of generating each HTML element individually with JavaScript.",
				mainChallenges: [
					"This is the first project I made using WebPack, and JavaScript ES6 modules, to bundle a project's JavaScript files together, giving me the opportunity to learn how to import and export JS files or functions into a different file. I made use of CSS media queries, flex and grid to make the site responsive for mobile view. This was not part of the project's outline, but in a real use case for a restaurant site it would need to be responsive.",
